- use AntD components AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE (buttons, cards, typography, tags, form, etc)
- in form: as placeholders put examples of real value (placeholder="100ms")
- use const if needed
- formulas should looks pretty (like in latex)
- be responsive / adaptive (support mobile)
- Break down the UI into smaller, single-responsibility components
- page structure:
pages/
└── [PageName]/
    ├── components/
    |   ├── ComponentA.tsx
    |   └── ...
    ├── [PageName]Page.tsx
    ├── index.ts
    └── utils.ts
